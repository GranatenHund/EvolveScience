# EvolveScience

  EvolveScience is a website that contains information regarding cosmic objects such as active galaxies, black holes, stars, planets, asteroids, and their descriptions and examples within. 
  
  It is developed using Flask, so make sure you have it installed in your Python Environment.
  
  Steps:
  
 
    1. Download the entire folder called EvolveScience.
    2. Run main.py using CMD.
    3. Access the home page by typing "http://127.0.0.1:5000/" on your preferred browser.
    4. Use the navbar to navigate different webpages.
  
  Note: If you are going to modify this code, make sure that you keep the folder structure identical because flask requires having css and images in "static" folder and the html files in "template" folder.
