# EvolveScience

  EvolveScience is a website that contains information regarding cosmic objects such as active galaxies, black holes, stars, planets, asteroids, and their descriptions and examples within. 
  
  It is developed using Flask, so make sure you have it installed in your Python Environment.
  
Steps:
------  
 
1. Download the entire folder called EvolveScience.

2. Run main.py using CMD.
    Make sure you have Flask Installed in your system for this to work.
    
    If you don't have Flask installed in your system click this [FLASK](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/flask/flask_environment.htm) tutorial.

3. Access the home page by typing "http://127.0.0.1:5000/" on your preferred browser.

    Note: If you are going to modify this code, make sure that you keep the folder structure identical because flask requires having css and images in "static" folder and the html files in "template" folder.
